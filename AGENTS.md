# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- lib/: Dart source (widgets, services, utils). Prefer feature-first folders (e.g., lib/features/profile/, lib/features/projects/).
- test/: Unit/widget tests mirroring lib/ structure (e.g., test/features/.../*_test.dart).
- assets/: Static files declared in pubspec.yaml (e.g., assets/images/, assets/fonts/).
- platform targets: android/, ios/, web/, macos/, windows/, linux/ as generated by Flutter.
- config: pubspec.yaml (deps/assets), analysis_options.yaml (lints) if present.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- flutter pub get: Install dependencies.
- flutter run -d chrome: Run the app on web for local development.
- flutter analyze: Static analysis and lint checks.
- dart format .: Auto-format code (2-space indent, line width per Dart defaults).
- flutter test: Run unit and widget tests.
- flutter test --coverage: Run tests with coverage reporting (lcov.info).
- flutter build web: Production web build (outputs to build/web).
- flutter build apk --release: Android release artifact.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 2 spaces; no tabs. Keep lines concise and readable.
- Naming: UpperCamelCase for classes/types; lowerCamelCase for vars, methods; lower_snake_case for file/folder names; Widget classes end with Widget when helpful.
- Imports: Prefer relative imports within lib/; avoid deep package: imports across features.
- Linting/formatting: Code must pass flutter analyze and dart format.

## Testing Guidelines
- Framework: flutter_test with package:mocktail or package:mockito if used.
- Structure: Mirror lib/; name tests *_test.dart.
- Expectations: Cover core logic and widgets with deterministic tests; prefer golden tests for stable UI where applicable.
- Commands: flutter test and optionally flutter test --coverage; aim for meaningful coverage (e.g., >80% on core modules).

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: Conventional Commits (e.g., feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:, ci:). Imperative, present tense, concise scope.
- PRs: Clear description, linked issues, before/after screenshots for UI changes, test updates, and any config/migration notes. Ensure CI (analyze, test, build) passes.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets. Use --dart-define/--dart-define-from-file for runtime configuration.
- Keep assets declared in pubspec.yaml and validate licensing for media/fonts.
