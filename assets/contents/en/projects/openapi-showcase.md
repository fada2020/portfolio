## OpenAPI Showcase & cURL Builder

A simple API explorer inside the portfolio that parses an OpenAPI JSON file and renders endpoints with:

- Search by path/summary/operationId, optional tag filtering and grouping
- Optional Authorization header injection with a bearer token
- Request/Response schema preview (application/json)
- Oneâ€‘click cURL generation with sample payloads inferred from JSON Schema

This improves DX for readers by showing how the API looks and how to try it quickly.
